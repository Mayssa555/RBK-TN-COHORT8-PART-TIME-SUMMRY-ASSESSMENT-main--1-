<h1>Higher Order Functions Exercises</h1>
This repository contains four JavaScript exercises that require the use of higher order functions.

<strong>Functions</strong>

<h2>each</h2>
The each function iterates over an array or object and applies a given function to each element.

The f<h2>filter</h2>ilter function takes an array and a predicate function and returns a new array with all the elements that pass the predicate test.

The filter function takes an array and a predicate function and returns a new array with all the elements that pass the predicate test.

<h2>map</h2>
The map function takes an array and a function and returns a new array with the result of applying the function to each element.

<h2>reduce</h2>
The reduce function takes an array, a reducer function, and an optional initial value and returns a single value that is the result of applying the reducer function to each element of the array.

<h1>Exercises</h1>
Write a function called calculateTotal that takes an array of objects representing items in a shopping cart. Each object has two properties: price and quantity. The function should use each to iterate over the array and calculate the total price of all the items in the cart. The function should return the total price.

Write a function called countEvenNumbers that takes an array of numbers and returns the count of even numbers in the array. Students should use only one of the higher-order functions provided to implement this function.

Write a function called filterWords that takes an array of words and a string prefix and returns a new array of words that start with the given prefix. You can only use one of the higher-order functions provided to implement this function.

Write a function called capitalizeFirstLetter that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a new array with the first letter of each string capitalized.

<h1>Constraints</h1>
For each exercise, students can only use one of the higher-order functions provided. This means that if they use filter in the first function, they cannot use it in the next function. Students should use a different higher-order function for each exercise.
